# Triangulated-Irregular-Network

Implementation of a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) to model a drainage network problem for an hydrology company. The requirements are:

- Plot the elevation profile using different colors for different ranges of elevations.
- Given the planar location of a point find its corresponding elevating value.
- Given the planar location of a point find its largest-area drainage basin.
- Measure the accuracy of the sampling performed on the terrain. That is, find the largest and smallest angles in the triangulation.
- Find a complete pipe network, that is, a planar graph connecting all the locations sampled.
